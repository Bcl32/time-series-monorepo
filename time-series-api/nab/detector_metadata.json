      "description": "The algorithm computes, for each record at step x in a data stream, the probability that the current record is part of a stream of length n for all n <= x. For a given record, if the maximimum of all the probabilities corresponds to a stream length of zero, the record represents a changepoint in the data stream. These probabilities are used to calculate anomaly scores for NAB results.",

      "description": " The algorithm is based on a hypothesis testing approach that compares observed data against multiple null hypotheses, representing frequencies of quantized data over a window. If the observed data is unseen and does not agree with any existing hypothesis, it is declared anomalous and a new hypothesis is created. Otherwise, it is declared non-anomalous, provided that the accepted hypothesis occurs frequently enough. Decision to accept/reject a null hypothesis is based on relative entropy compared against a threshold of acceptable false negative probability determined by the chi-squared distribution. Step-by-step details are given in code comments and parameters have been tuned for best performance of NAB.",
