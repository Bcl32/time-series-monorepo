      "description": " The algorithm is based on a hypothesis testing approach that compares observed data against multiple null hypotheses, representing frequencies of quantized data over a window. If the observed data is unseen and does not agree with any existing hypothesis, it is declared anomalous and a new hypothesis is created. Otherwise, it is declared non-anomalous, provided that the accepted hypothesis occurs frequently enough. Decision to accept/reject a null hypothesis is based on relative entropy compared against a threshold of acceptable false negative probability determined by the chi-squared distribution. Step-by-step details are given in code comments and parameters have been tuned for best performance of NAB.",
